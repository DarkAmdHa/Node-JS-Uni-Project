    name: 'Recent advances in the development of aerospace materials',
    excerpt:
      'In recent years, much progress has been made on the development of aerospace materials for structural and engine applications. Alloys, such as Al-based alloys, Mg-based alloys, Ti-based alloys, and Ni-based alloys, are developed for aerospace industry with outstanding advantages. Composite materials, the innovative materials, are taking more and more important roles in aircrafts. However, recent aerospace materials still face some major challenges, such as insufficient mechanical properties, fretting wear, stress corrosion cracking, and corrosion. Consequently, extensive studies have been conducted to develop the next generation aerospace materials with superior mechanical performance and corrosion resistance to achieve improvements in both performance and life cycle cost. This review focuses on the following topics: (1) materials requirements in design of aircraft structures and engines, (2) recent advances in the development of aerospace materials, (3) challenges faced by recent aerospace materials, and (4) future trends in aerospace materials.',

    excerpt:
      'A spacecraft propulsion is any method used to accelerate spacecraft and artificial satellites. There are several different methods, each with advantages and disadvantages, spacecraft propulsion being an active area of research. However, most current spacecraft are propelled by forcing a gas exits through the rear of the vehicle at high speed through supersonic nozzle of a rocket engine. All spacecraft are using chemical rockets (fuel or solid fuel) to launch, although some (such as Pegasus missiles and Space Ship One) are using air jet engines in the first step. Most satellites have simple chemical thrusters (often missiles mono) or missiles resistojet to maintain orbit. Soviet bloc satellites have used electric propulsion for decades and the new Western geo-orbital spacecraft begin using electric propulsion for orbit maintenance of north-south. There is a need increasingly of more new propulsion systems, modern, technology-based.',

    name: 'Experimental evaluation in computer science: A quantitative study',
    excerpt:
      'A survey of 400 recent research articles suggests that computer scientists publish relatively few papers with experimentally validated results. The survey includes complete volumes of several refereed computer science journals, a conference, and 50 titles drawn at random from all articles published by ACM in 1993. The journals of Optical Engineering (OE) and Neural Computation (NC) were used for comparison. Of the papers in the random sample that would require experimental validation, 40% have none at all. In journals related to software engineering, this fraction is 50%. In comparison, the fraction of papers lacking quantitative evaluation in OE and NC is only 15% and 12%, respectively. Conversely, the fraction of papers that devote one fifth or more of their space to experimental validation is almost 70% for OE and NC, while it is a mere 30% for the computer science (CS) random sample and 20% for software engineering. The low ratio of validated results appears to be a serious weakness in computer science research. This weakness should be rectified for the long-term health of the field. The fundamental principle of science, the definition almost, is this: the sole test of the validity of any idea is experiment. —Richard P. Feynman. Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it. —Donald E. Knuth',
