    excerpt:
      'In recent years, much progress has been made on the development of aerospace materials for structural and engine applications. Alloys, such as Al-based alloys, Mg-based alloys, Ti-based alloys, and Ni-based alloys, are developed for aerospace industry with outstanding advantages. Composite materials, the innovative materials, are taking more and more important roles in aircrafts. However, recent aerospace materials still face some major challenges, such as insufficient mechanical properties, fretting wear, stress corrosion cracking, and corrosion. Consequently, extensive studies have been conducted to develop the next generation aerospace materials with superior mechanical performance and corrosion resistance to achieve improvements in both performance and life cycle cost. This review focuses on the following topics: (1) materials requirements in design of aircraft structures and engines, (2) recent advances in the development of aerospace materials, (3) challenges faced by recent aerospace materials, and (4) future trends in aerospace materials.',

    excerpt:
      'A spacecraft propulsion is any method used to accelerate spacecraft and artificial satellites. There are several different methods, each with advantages and disadvantages, spacecraft propulsion being an active area of research. However, most current spacecraft are propelled by forcing a gas exits through the rear of the vehicle at high speed through supersonic nozzle of a rocket engine. All spacecraft are using chemical rockets (fuel or solid fuel) to launch, although some (such as Pegasus missiles and Space Ship One) are using air jet engines in the first step. Most satellites have simple chemical thrusters (often missiles mono) or missiles resistojet to maintain orbit. Soviet bloc satellites have used electric propulsion for decades and the new Western geo-orbital spacecraft begin using electric propulsion for orbit maintenance of north-south. There is a need increasingly of more new propulsion systems, modern, technology-based.',
